IR Final Project Design Doc
___________________________

NOTE: Rebecca I have no clue what you mean by "design doc" so please take pity on this poor academic who's never done a day of real software engineering in their life.

Reccomendations for how to begin:
    If you're down with using flask and ginja, we can just take the starter code for one of the assignments and clear out anything that was assignment-specific so that we don't have to start from scratch. 
    This way we'll have some of the controller/html stuff done for us. 

Some Goals:
1. Get location data from documents in the corpus
    1.1 Be able to run IR algorithms on corpus
        1.1.1 Download corpus
        1.1.2 Read & store corpus in some format (pandas? json?)
        1.1.3 EDA - Take a look at whats in there and try to figure out how the hell we're gonna extract location. Also, are there any other things we should look at extracting? Demographic info? Idk my meds are wearing off, but papers will often have keyword sections which might be usefull. 
    1.2 Run IR algorithms on corpus
        1.2.1 Determine what kind of approach we should take. Is there one that we are the most comfortable with? One that makes more sense than the others?
        1.2.2 Pre-processing. What kind of pre-processing needs to be done for our chosen approach?
        1.2.3 Run & adjust the chosen approach until we are satasfied with the results.
2. Display location data from the corpus
    2.1 Create a web page. I like flask, but I'm open to any suggestions that aren't ruby on rails. 
    2.2 Create visualization
        2.2.1 Steal the javascript from this page: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/world-airports-voronoi
        2.2.2 Turn locations from strings to long, lat values
        2.2.3 Edit the js to take our location data
        2.2.4 Stretch goal: make points clickable links and or make map zoomable (there's some more d3 code online we can 'borrow' for this)
3. Do all this again with some other attribute that isn't location
